Blimp-1 promotes terminal differentiation of virus-specific CD8 T cells and represses the acquisition of central memory T cell properties.

SUMMARY
During acute infections, a small population of effector CD8 T cells evades terminal differentiation and survives as long-lived memory T cells. We demonstrate that the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1 enhances the formation of terminally differentiated CD8 T cells during LCMV infection, and Blimp-1 deficiency promotes the acquisition of memory cell properties by effector cells. Blimp-1 expression is preferentially increased in terminally differentiated effector and “effector memory” (TEM) CD8 T cells, and gradually decays after infection as central memory (TCM) cells develop. Blimp-1-/- effector CD8 T cells show some reduction in effector molecule expression, but primarily develop into memory precursor cells that survive better, and more rapidly acquire several TCM attributes, including CD62L and IL-2 expression and enhanced proliferative responses. These results reveal a critical role for Blimp-1 in controlling terminal differentiation and suppressing memory cell developmental potential in effector CD8 T cells during viral infection.
