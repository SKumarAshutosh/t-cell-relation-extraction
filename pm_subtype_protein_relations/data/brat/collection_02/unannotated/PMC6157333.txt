Mycobacterium tuberculosis Virulent Factor ESAT-6 Drives Macrophage Differentiation Toward the Pro-inflammatory M1 Phenotype and Subsequently Switches It to the Anti-inflammatory M2 Phenotype.

Tuberculosis, a human infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The success of M.tb as a pathogen relies mainly on its ability to divert the host innate immune responses. One way by which M.tb maintains a persistent infection in a “silent” granuloma is to inhibit inflammation and induce an immunoregulatory phenotype in host macrophages (MΦs). However, M.tb effectors governing the switch of MΦs from the pro-inflammatory M1 to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype remain to be determined. The Early Secreted Antigenic Target 6 kDa or ESAT-6, has been implicated in the virulence and pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Here, we investigated roles of ESAT-6 in MΦ differentiation and polarization. We found that treatment of human monocytes with ESAT-6 did not interfere with differentiation of M1 MΦs. However, ESAT-6 promoted differentiation of M0 and M2 MΦs toward the M1 phenotype, as indicated by secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α, and induction of a typical M1 transcriptional signature. Interestingly, we found that ESAT-6 switched terminal full activation of M1 polarized MΦs to the M2 phenotype. Indeed, in the pro-inflammatory M1 MΦs, ESAT-6 was able to inhibit IL-12 and TNF-α secretion and stimulate that of IL-10. Moreover, gene expression profiling of these cells showed that ESAT-6 induced downregulation of M1 MΦ cell surface molecules CD80 and CD86, transcription factors IRF5 and c-MAF, cytokines IL-12, IL-10, and IL-6, as well as chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL1. Overall, our findings suggest ESAT-6 as being one of the effectors used by M.tb to induce the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype at the primo-infection; a prerequisite step to promote granuloma formation and subsequently drive the phenotype switch of MΦ polarization from M1 to M2 at a later stage of the infection. Our study improves current knowledge regarding mechanisms of virulence of M.tb and may be helpful to develop novel tools targeting ESAT-6 for a better and more efficient treatment of tuberculosis.



Tuberculosis, due to infection with M.tb, is a leading infectious disease and one of the major causes of death worldwide. Since 1993, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared tuberculosis as being a global public health emergency and intensified its efforts to control this severe airborne disease. Indeed, every year approximately 10 million new tuberculosis cases and 2 million deaths are reported around the globe (WHO, 2017).
In pulmonary tuberculosis for instance, M.tb infects the first immunological barrier, namely alveolar MΦs (Cambier et al., 2014; Orme, 2014). MΦs are versatile cells with a high degree of plasticity, thus exhibiting a considerable phenotypic diversity that confers them the ability to efficiently respond to environmental cues (Wang et al., 2014; Sica et al., 2015). MΦs play crucial roles in tuberculosis not only as a reservoir for M.tb intracellular growth, but also as important mycobacterial antigen-presenting cells (Cambier et al., 2014; Orme, 2014). Recently, the concept of MΦ activation and polarization has emerged (Sica and Mantovani, 2012; Martinez and Gordon, 2014; Murray et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Sica et al., 2015; Murray, 2017). Two well established polarized phenotypes were recognized based on MΦ gene expression induced in response to pathogen and cytokine stimulation (Sica and Mantovani, 2012; Martinez and Gordon, 2014; Murray et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Sica et al., 2015; Murray, 2017). MΦs were subsequently classified into the “classically activated M1” MΦ phenotype and the “alternatively activated M2” MΦ phenotype (Sica and Mantovani, 2012; Martinez and Gordon, 2014; Murray et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Sica et al., 2015; Murray, 2017). M1 and M2 MΦ responses describe the opposing activities of killing and repairing, respectively. Activated M1 MΦs are considered potent effector cells of the innate immune response, which kill microorganisms and cancer cells and promote Th1 immune responses (Martinez and Gordon, 2014; Murray et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Sica et al., 2015; Murray, 2017). Differentiation of monocytes into M1 MΦs occurs in presence of GM-CSF, while their full activation is obtained upon stimulation by IFN-γ alone or in conjunction with microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α (Martinez and Gordon, 2014; Murray et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Sica et al., 2015; Murray, 2017). Typical characteristics of M1 MΦs include high antigen presentation, high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12, IL-1β, IL-23, IL-6, and TNF-α, as well as high production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates. M1 MΦ signature also involves upregu
