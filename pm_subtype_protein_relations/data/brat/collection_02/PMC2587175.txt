TH17 lineage differentiation is programmed by orphan nuclear receptors RORα and RORγ.

The functional differentiation of T cells is mediated by lineage-specific transcription factors. TH17 has been recently identified as a distinct TH lineage that mediates tissue inflammation. RORγ was previously shown to regulate TH17 differentiation; RORγ deficiency, however, did not completely abolish TH17 cytokine expression. Here we report that TH17 cells also highly express another related nuclear receptor RORα, which is induced by TGFβ and IL-6 in a STAT3-dependent manner. Over-expression of RORα promotes TH17 differentiation and significantly upregulates IL-17 and IL-17F expression, possibly through the CNS2 element in the IL-17-IL-17F gene locus. RORα deficiency results in reduced IL-17 expression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that RORα and RORγ co-expression synergistically leads to greater TH17 differentiation. Double deficiencies in RORα and RORγ globally impair TH17 generation and completely protect mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Therefore, TH17 lineage differentiation is mediated by both RORα and RORγ.
