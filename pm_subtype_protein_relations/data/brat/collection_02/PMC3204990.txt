Spleen-Resident CD4+ and CD4− CD8α− Dendritic Cell Subsets Differ in Their Ability to Prime Invariant Natural Killer T Lymphocytes.

One important function of conventional dendritic cells (cDC) is their high capacity to capture, process and present Ag to T lymphocytes. Mouse splenic cDC subtypes, including CD8α+ and CD8α− cDC, are not identical in their Ag presenting and T cell priming functions. Surprisingly, few studies have reported functional differences between CD4− and CD4+ CD8α− cDC subsets. We show that, when loaded in vitro with OVA peptide or whole protein, and in steady-state conditions, splenic CD4− and CD4+ cDC are equivalent in their capacity to prime and direct CD4+ and CD8+ T cell differentiation. In contrast, in response to α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), CD4− and CD4+ cDC differentially activate invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells, a population of lipid-reactive non-conventional T lymphocytes. Both cDC subsets equally take up α-GalCer in vitro and in vivo to stimulate the iNKT hybridoma DN32.D3, the activation of which depends solely on TCR triggering. On the other hand, and relative to their CD4+ counterparts, CD4− cDC more efficiently stimulate primary iNKT cells, a phenomenon likely due to differential production of co-factors (including IL-12) by cDC. Our data reveal a novel functional difference between splenic CD4+ and CD4− cDC subsets that may be important in immune responses.



The dendritic cell (DC) network is essential for the initiation and the regulation of immune responses. Dendritic cells are specialized in Ag capture, processing and presentation on MHC molecules [1]. The interaction of DC with naive T lymphocytes can lead to different forms of immune responses (type 1, type 2 or type 17 responses or tolerance), the outcome of which depends on the type of DC as well as their activation state [2]. Along with their ability to prime naive T lymphocytes and shape the adaptive immune response, DC also play a major role in the activation of innate immune cells including NK and invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. Invariant NKT cells represent an emerging population of “innate-like” immune cells expressing NK lineage receptors and an invariant TCRα chain (Vα14-Jα18 rearrangement in mice and Vα24-Jα18 rearrangement in humans) that pairs with a limited number of Vβ chains. This cell population recognizes exogenous and self (glyco)lipid Ag presented by the CD1d molecule expressed by Ag presenting cells, including DC (for reviews, [3]–[7]). In response to CD1d-restricted lipids such as α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), a non-mammalian glycolipid Ag with potent anti-tumor properties [8], iNKT cells rapidly and vigorously produce a wide array of immunomodulatory cytokines including IFN-γ and IL-4. This explosive response leads to downstream activation of DC, NK cells, neutrophils and B and T cells with important outcomes on immune responses and pathologies (for reviews, [3], [7], [9], [10].
Dendritic cells are heterogeneous and can be classified into different subtypes according to their phenotype, tissue distribution and functions. Spleen-resident DC are mainly composed of conventional DC (cDC) that can be further subdivided into distinct subtypes, including CD8α− cDC, encompassing CD4+ and CD4− subsets, and CD8α+ cDC, expressing or not the CD103 molecule [11], [12]. Over the last decade, several reports pointed out a functional dichotomy between CD8α− cDC, the most numerous cDC subtype in the spleen, and CD8α+ cDC. Thus, CD8α+ cDC serve as efficient APC for inducing a Th1 response and, through their cross-presenting capacity, for priming CTL response whereas CD8α− cDC preferentially present exogenous Ag to prime CD4+ T cells and to induce Th2 responses [1], [13]–[16]. More recently, functional differences within CD8α+ cDC subsets have been underlined. Of major importance is the recent demonstration that CD8α+CD103+ cDC, a subpopulation that localises in the marginal zone of the spleen, is critical for either tolerance induction to cell-associated Ag or cross-priming in response to systemic activation stimuli [17], [18]. Splenic CD8α− cDC subsets (now termed CD4+ and CD4− cDC for the sake of simplicity) are closely related phylogenetically although recent transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed some differences that may be important for their respective functions [19], [20]. Functional studies aimed at comparing CD4+ and CD4− cDC are very limited and sometimes contradictory. Hochrein et al. first reported that CD4− cDC are more efficient at producing IL-12 after CD40 ligation or TLR stimulation whereas two other studies reported no major differences in IL-12 production between the two cDC subsets in response to Leishmania infection [21]–[23]. Proietto et al. also reported that CD4+ cDC are the main producers of inflammatory chemokines after TLR activation [24]. The ability of CD4+ and CD4− cDC to prime and orientate CD4+ T lymphocytes upon sensitization with OVA peptide has been stud
