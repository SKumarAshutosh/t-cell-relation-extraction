Germinal center B cell development has distinctly regulated stages completed by disengagement from T cell help.

To reconcile conflicting reports on the role of CD40 signaling in germinal center (GC) formation, we examined the earliest stages of murine GC B cell differentiation. Peri-follicular GC precursors first expressed intermediate levels of BCL6 while co-expressing the transcription factors RelB and IRF4, the latter known to repress Bcl6 transcription. Transition of GC precursors to the BCL6hi follicular state was associated with cell division, although the number of required cell divisions was immunogen dose dependent. Potentiating T cell help or CD40 signaling in these GC precursors actively repressed GC B cell maturation and diverted their fate towards plasmablast differentiation, whereas depletion of CD4+ T cells promoted this initial transition. Thus while CD40 signaling in B cells is necessary to generate the immediate precursors of GC B cells, transition to the BCL6hi follicular state is promoted by a regional and transient diminution of T cell help.

Germinal centers (GCs) are specialized structures that form within B cell follicles in response to immunization or pathogen exposure. Within defined anatomical niches of mature GCs, antigen specific GC B cells intermittently engage cognate T follicular helper cells (Tfh). Competitive GC B cells are instructed to undergo further rounds of proliferation, and ultimately differentiate into memory B cells and long-term high-affinity plasma cells (De Silva and Klein, 2015). In contrast to mature GCs, the initial formation of GC founder/precursor cells remains poorly understood. The initiation of GCs is regulated by a series of dynamic cellular events. After antigen binding and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, activated follicular B cells migrate to the T/B border and interfollicular (IF) regions. At the periphery of follicles, responding B and T cells engage, separate and re-form contacts with new cognate partners over the course of several days (Kerfoot et al., 2011). Initial B cell commitment to the GC lineage and divergence from the short-term antibody secreting cell (ASC) path occurs during this time period (Kerfoot et al., 2011). Intermediate levels of BCL6 have been observed in some activated B cells prior to follicular re-entry and GC seeding (Kerfoot et al., 2011; Kitano et al., 2011). Interestingly, Tfh migration into the follicle interior precedes that of GC committed B cells (Kerfoot et al., 2011).
Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to influence the mode of differentiation of activated B cells to either the GC or ASC lineages. In vitro culture studies have suggested that B cell fate decisions are a stochastic and B cell autonomous process (Hasbold et al., 2004, 1998; Hodgkin et al., 1996). Other studies have instead suggested that either the initial BCR signal strength (O'Connor et al., 2006; Paus et al., 2006) or competition for antigen and its presentation to cognate Th cells (Schwickert et al., 2011) are deciding factors. B cell lineage commitment is orchestrated by opposing transcriptional networks thought to be mutually antagonistic. The transcriptional repressor BCL6 is essential for GC B cell development (De Silva and Klein, 2015; Dent et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2014; Kitano et al., 2011) and represses the transcription factors IRF4 and Blimp1, preventing ASC formation (Basso and Dalla-Favera, 2012). By contrast, high levels of IRF4 or induction of Blimp1 represses transcription of Bcl6 and facilitates ASC differentiation (Nutt et al., 2015). Bcl6 protein levels can be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (Duan et al., 2012; Saito et al., 2006; Takahashi et al., 2012).
CD40 signaling plays a pivotal role in the generation of GCs (Foy et al., 1996). CD40 signals via the non-canonical NFκB pathway that uniquely invokes the nuclear translocation of heterodimeric RelB/p52 (Fusco et al., 2008; Hömig-Hölzel et al., 2008; Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009). Although CD40 signaling is clearly a necessary component of GC formation, a transcriptional program consistent with persistent CD40 signaling is not seen in GC B cells (Basso et al., 2004). Moreover, chronic CD40 signaling is known to antagonize GC B cell formation and instead promotes plasma cell differentiation (Allman et al., 1996; Bolduc et al., 2010; Kishi et al., 2010; Nutt et al., 2015; Saito et al., 2007). This is in part mediated by IRF4, a transcription factor promoted by RelB. However, IRF4 appears to be essential for the differentiation of both GC B cells and ASCs (Klein et al., 2006; Ochiai et al., 2013; Sciammas et al., 2006; Willis et al., 2014). Distinct DNA binding modes of IRF4 dependent on protein concentration may account for these opposing roles of IRF4 (Ochiai et al., 2013). To further confound things, a key cytokine secreted by Tfh cells, IL-21, has also been shown to be an important
