Absence of the Adaptor Protein PEA-15 Is Associated with Altered Pattern of Th Cytokines Production by Activated CD4+ T Lymphocytes In Vitro, and Defective Red Blood Cell Alloimmune Response In Vivo
.

TCR-dependent and costimulation signaling, cell division, and cytokine environment are major factors driving cytokines expression induced by CD4+ T cell activation. PEA-15 15 (Protein Enriched in Astrocyte / 15kDa) is an adaptor protein that regulates death receptor-induced apoptosis and proliferation signaling by binding to FADD and relocating ERK1/2 to the cytosol, respectively. By using PEA-15-deficient mice, we examined the role of PEA-15 in TCR-dependent cytokine production in CD4+ T cells. TCR-stimulated PEA-15-deficient CD4+ T cells exhibited defective progression through the cell cycle associated with impaired expression of cyclin E and phosphoRb, two ERK1/2-dependent proteins of the cell cycle. Accordingly, expression of the division cycle-dependent cytokines IL-2 and IFNγ, a Th1 cytokine, was reduced in stimulated PEA-15-deficient CD4+ T cells. This was associated with abnormal subcellular compartmentalization of activated ERK1/2 in PEA-15-deficient T cells. Furthermore, in vitro TCR-dependent differentiation of naive CD4+ CD62L+ PEA-15-deficient T cells was associated with a lower production of the Th2 cytokine, IL-4, whereas expression of the Th17-associated molecule IL4I1 was enhanced. Finally, a defective humoral response was shown in PEA-15-deficient mice in a model of red blood cell alloimmunization performed with Poly IC, a classical adjuvant of Th1 response in vivo. Collectively, our data suggest that PEA-15 contributes to the specification of the cytokine pattern of activated Th cells, thus highlighting a potential new target to interfere with T cell functional polarization and subsequent immune response.



The mechanisms by which naïve CD4+ T cells differentiate into different cell functional fates that include the T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, and T regulatory (Treg) cell lineages, characterized by a specific pattern of cytokines production, are of much interest in understanding how host immune response become adapted to different challenges [1,2]. Although cytokine environment and costimulation are major factors influencing CD4+ T cell differentiation, the cell division cycle is an intrinsic cue that has been involved in the specification of cytokine expression in Th cell, considering that DNA replication allows chromatin remodeling and demethylation of effector Th cytokine loci [3–6]. However, other studies suggested that DNA replication might not be mechanistically linked to Th cytokine specification [7,8]. Alternatively, different signaling pathways from the TCR complex itself were shown to influence the set of cytokine genes transcribed [9]. In particular, the involvement of ERK1/2 in T cell functional polarization was previously shown in different reports where the authors explain that TCR signal strength-dependent magnitude of ERK1/2 activity, as well as the duration of ERK1/2 activation control Th1 versus Th2 outcome of T cell activation [10–15], or Th17 versus regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation [16–19]. ERK1/2 signaling has been also involved in regulation of G1 cell cycle progression [20]. However, whether ERK1/2 activation or compartmentalization contributes to cell cycle-dependent Th differentiation is not known.
The DED (death effector domain)-containing adaptor PEA-15 (Protein Enriched in Astrocytes/ 15k kDa) [21] regulates multiple cellular functions depending on the cell type. PEA-15 contains a nuclear export sequence that mediates the relocation of ERK1/2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby regulating the Ras-dependent signaling pathway [22–25]. Another role of PEA-15 is to inhibit apoptosis induced by Fas, TNF-α or TRAIL, by interacting with the DED of FADD and caspase-8, and blocking DISC formation. The mitochondrial protein Htra2/OMI promotes apoptosis by targeting PEA-15 to proteasome (reviewed in [23]).
Here, we have taken advantage of PEA-15-deficient mice [26], to study the impact of PEA-15 deficiency on TCR-dependent specification of cytokine expression by CD4+ helper T cells.

PEA-15-deficient mice were previously described [26]. Mice were bred in our facility and backcrossed to a C57BL/6J background for 3 generations. For each experiment, PEA-15-/- animals and PEA-15+/+ sex-matched littermates from PEA-15+/- intercrosses, were used at 6–9 months of age. On the day of experiment, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. All animals were maintained in our conventional animal facilities and manipulated in accordance with protocols approved by the Paris Est Creteil University (UPEC) ethical committee (COMETH, Authorization N°11/12/12-16), according to European guidelines.
