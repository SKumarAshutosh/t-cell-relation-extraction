Inhibition of the immunoproteasome ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating immune mediated disease of the central nervous system. The immunoproteasome is a distinct class of proteasomes found predominantly in monocytes and lymphocytes. Recently, we demonstrated a novel function of immunoproteasomes in cytokine production and T cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of an inhibitor of the immunoproteasome (ONX 0914) in two different mouse models of MS. ONX 0914 attenuated disease progression after active and passive induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), both in MOG35–55 and PLP139–151-induced EAE. Isolation of lymphocytes from the brain or spinal cord revealed a strong reduction of cytokine-producing CD4+ cells in ONX 0914 treated mice. Additionally, ONX 0914 treatment prevented disease exacerbation in a relapsing-remitting model. An analysis of draining lymph nodes after induction of EAE revealed that the differentiation to Th17 or Th1 cells was strongly impaired in ONX 0914 treated mice. These results implicate the immunoproteasome in the development of EAE and suggest that immunoproteasome inhibitors are promising drugs for the treatment of MS.



Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex chronic immune mediated disease of the central nervous system, affecting approximately 1 in 1000 individuals in Europe and the US (Rosati, 2001). Environmental and genetic factors determine the susceptibility to develop the disease that is characterized by acute relapses of neurological deficit and remissions, and by a progressive accumulation of neurological and cognitive disability over time. MS pathology was originally defined by the presence of focal white matter lesions, due to primary demyelination with partial preservation of axons and reactive astrocytic scar formation (Lassmann, 2005). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a MS disease model in rodents, shares clinical and pathological features with MS (Whitehouse et al, 1969; Fuller et al, 2004; Sospedra & Martin, 2005; Croxford et al, 2011). In this model, sensitization with central nervous system (CNS) antigens breaks immunological tolerance of autoreactive T cells, enabling them to cross the blood brain barrier and induce brain inflammation.
The proteasome is a large intracellular multicatalytic protease found both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus controlling multiple cellular processes (Peters et al, 1994). The 20S proteasome is a barrel-shaped complex of four rings with seven subunits each. The outer two rings consist of α subunits, the inner two rings of β subunits forming the central proteolytic chamber (Huber et al, 2012). Three of the β subunits designated β1, β2, and β5 bear the active centers of the 20S proteasome. In cells stimulated with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or in cells of hematopoietic origin, the catalytic subunits LMP2 (β1i), MECL-1 (β2i), and LMP7 (β5i) replace the constitutive subunits β1, β2, and β5 during neosynthesis and build the so-called immunoproteasome. The immunological benefit of this process is attributed to minor structural changes within the proteasome (Huber et al, 2012) and an altered cleavage pattern, thus, the immunoproteasome optimizes quality and quantity of MHC class I presented peptides (Groettrup et al, 1995; Schwarz et al, 2000; Sijts et al, 2000; Toes et al, 2001). Thereby, the immunoproteasome alters class I ligand generation and, thus, shapes the naive CD8-T cell repertoire in the thymus and cytotoxic T cell responses in the periphery (Chen et al, 2001; Basler et al, 2004, 2006, 2011; Groettrup et al, 2010; Kincaid et al, 2012). Apart from its role in antigen presentation, we have recently shown that the immunoproteasome plays a crucial role in T cell expansion and autoimmune diseases (Muchamuel et al, 2009; Basler et al, 2010, 2013; Moebius et al, 2010). ONX 0914 (formerly named PR-957), an LMP7-selective epoxyketone inhibitor of the immunoproteasome, reduced cytokine production in activated monocytes or T cells and attenuated disease progression in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, colitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (Muchamuel et al, 2009; Basler et al, 2010; Ichikawa et al, 2012). Additionally, ONX 0914 blocked differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells to IL-17 producing cells in vitro (Muchamuel et al, 2009).
These results prompted us to investigate the clinical effect of ONX 0914 in two different mouse models of MS. In MOG35–55-and PLP139–151-induced EAE, ONX 0914 attenuated disease progression in diseased animals following immunization with autoantigen or transfer of autoreactive T cells. Blockade of LMP7 prevented infiltration of immune cells into the brain and spinal cord and diminished initial Th1 and Th17 differentiation. Thus, our results suggest that the inhibition of LMP7 holds potential as a novel approach for the trea
