Effector T cell plasticity: flexibility in the face of changing circumstances.

As additional states of CD4 T cell differentiation are uncovered, their flexibility is also beginning to be recognized. Components that control the plasticity of CD4 T cell populations include their cellular conditions, clonality, transcriptional circuitry and chromatin modifications. Appearance of cellular flexibility may arise from truly flexible genetic programs or alternately heterogeneous populations. New tools will be needed to define the rules that allow or prohibit cellular transitions.
