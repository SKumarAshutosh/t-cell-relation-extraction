The differential expression of IL-4 and IL-13 and its impact on type-2 Immunity.

Allergic disease represents a significant global health burden, and disease incidence continues to rise in urban areas of the world. As such, a better understanding of the basic immune mechanisms underlying disease pathology are likely the key to developing therapeutic interventions to both prevent disease onset as well as to ameliorate disease morbidity in those individuals already suffering from a disorder linked to type-2 inflammation. Two factors central to type-2 immunity are interleukin(IL)-4 and IL-13. These two cytokines have been linked to virtually all of the major disease hallmarks associated with type-2 inflammation. Therefore, IL-4 and IL-13 and their regulatory pathways represent ideal targets to suppress disease. However, despite sharing many common regulatory pathways and receptors, these cytokines perform very distinct functions during a type-2 immune response. This review summarizes the literature surrounding the function and expression of IL-4 and IL-13 in CD4+ T cells and innate immune cells. It highlights recent in vivo findings regarding the differential expression and non-canonical regulation of IL-4 and IL-13 in various immune cells, which likely play an underappreciated and important role in type-2 allergic immunity.
