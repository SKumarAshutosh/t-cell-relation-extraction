Myeloid Suppressor Cells Induced by Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells Inhibit Autoreactive T-Cell Responses That Lead to Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis.

The authors show that RPE cells induce MDSC differentiation, which could be another mechanism by which RPE cells regulate immune responses in the retina.
