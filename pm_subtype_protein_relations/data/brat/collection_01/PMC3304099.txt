Cytokine receptor modulation by interleukin-2 broadly regulates T helper cell lineage differentiation

T helper (TH) cells control host-defense to pathogens. The receptors for IL-12, IL-4, and IL-6 are required for TH1, TH2, and TH17 differentiation, respectively. IL-2 signaling via the transcription factor STAT5 controls TH2 differentiation by regulating the TH2 cytokine gene cluster and Il4ra expression. Here we show that IL-2 regulates TH1 differentiation, inducing STAT5-dependent IL-12Rβ2 and T-bet expression, with impaired human TH1 differentiation when IL-2 was blocked. TH1 differentiation was also impaired in mouse Il2−/− T cells but restored by IL-12Rβ2 expression. Consistent with IL-2’s inhibition of TH17 differentiation, IL-2 decreased Il6ra and Il6st expression, and Il6st augmented TH17 differentiation even when IL-2 was present. Thus, IL-2 influences TH cell differentiation by modulating cytokine receptor expression to help specify and maintain differentiated states.


The process of T helper cell (TH) differentiation critically controls host defense for an array of pathogens.  Naïve CD4+ T cells can differentiate into a range of TH cells, and TH differentiation is determined in part via key cytokine receptor regulation and inclusion in the immunological synapse.  IL-12Rβ2 expression is required for TH1 differentiation,  IL-4Rα for TH2 differentiation,  and IL-6Rα and IL-6 signal transducer (IL-6ST; also known as gp130) for TH17 differentiation,     allowing responsiveness to IL-12, IL-4, and IL-6, respectively. For example, IL-12 and STAT4 together with T-bet promote differentiation into TH1 cells, which preferentially produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ);  IL-4 via STAT6 and GATA3 promote differentiation into TH2 cells, which produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13;     and TGF-β, IL-6, IL-23, IL-21 via STAT3 and RORγt together promote differentiation into TH17 cells, which produce IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22.
IL-2 is a pleiotropic cytokine with a broad array of actions.   Along with IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, it shares the common cytokine receptor γ chain, γc, which is mutated in humans with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency    as a critical receptor component. IL-2 signals via JAK1 and JAK3 to activate STAT5A and STAT5B, and additionally uses Ras-MAP kinase and phosphoinositol 3-kinase dependent signaling pathways . Among its many actions, IL-2 is a potent T cell growth factor, induces lymphokine-activated killer activity, boosts the cytolytic activity of NK cells, can augment immunoglobulin production, is a mediator of activation-induced cell death, and is an essential factor for the development of regulatory T (Treg) cells  . IL-2 is also known to critically regulate TH2 differentiation in a STAT5-dependent manner, acting early at the Il4ra locus to induce IL-4Rα expression  and later to open chromatin accessibility at the Il4-Il13-Rad50 TH2 locus , 12. Given the role of IL-2 in TH2 differentiation, as well as the ability of IL-2 to induce IFN-γ expression       and to decrease IL-17 production during TH17 differentiation  , we decided to investigate whether IL-2 is more broadly involved in TH differentiation by regulating corresponding cytokine receptors. IL-2 induced expression of IL-12R, and retroviral transduction of Il12rb2 reversed the defective TH1 differentiation in Il2−/− T cells. IL-2 also negatively regulated expression of Il6ra and of Il6st as at least a partial mechanism for negative regulation of TH17 differentiation. Therefore our data reveal that IL-2 regulates TH1, TH2, and TH17 differentiation based at least in part on its modulation of expression of key cytokine receptors.

We initially focused on the role of IL-2 in TH1 differentiation, a process that is driven by IL-12. IL-12 induces not only Ifng expression1 but also T-bet,  which promotes the survival and proliferation of differentiating TH1 cells.   T-bet induces Ifng,     and IL-12Rβ2 expression,   while inhibiting GATA3 binding to target genes, including the Il4 gene  , and thus TH2 differentiation. Naïve CD4+ T cells do not respond to IL-12 because they lack a key receptor component, IL-12Rβ23. Like TH2 differentiation, TH1 differentiation requires activation via the T-cell receptor (TCR), which induces production of IL-2. We therefore examined the effect of TCR stimulation on IFN-γ production in wild-type (WT) and Il2−/− T cells. We stimulated Il2+/+ or Il2−/− CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28, gating on proliferating cells based on FSC-SSC (Fig. 1a, upper two panels). Naïve Il2−/− CD4+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 had far fewer IFN-γ+ cells than did Il2+/+ CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1a, second pair of panels), consistent with previous observations that IL-2 induces IFN-γ production13, 14. Moreover, after two rounds of TH1 polarization, a lower percentage of Il2−/− CD4+ T cells expressed IFN-γ+ as compared to Il2+/+
cells (Fig. 1a, lower two sets of panels). Although IL-2 contributes to survival and accordingly the Il2−/− population had more dead cells than the Il2+/+ population after TH1 differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), in Fig. 1a, we gated on viable cells (see Annexin V and 7AAD staining in Supplementary Fig. 1a); thus the decrease in IFN-γ+ cells among Il2−/− T cells could not be attributed solely to diminished viability.
Because IL-2 is a T-cell growth factor, and because IFN-γ expression is known to increase with successive rounds of cell division19, we tested whether the role of IL-2 in TH1 differentiation was due solely to its effects on proliferation or whether it also had proliferation-independent effects on IFN-γ production. To follow cell division we labeled cells with CFSE and incubated them under TH1 conditions for 72 h. We observed the same number of rounds of cell division, but as anticipated, the Il2−/− T cells were delayed in their division relative to the Il2+/+ T cells (Fig. 1b, left panels). We compared the percentage of IFN-γ-producing cells in each division in the Il2+/+ and Il2−/− cell populations. As anticipated, IFN-γ expression increased with cell division in Il2+/+ cells, but there was a decrease in the percentage of IFN-γ-producing cells at each cell division in the Il2−/− T cells relative to the Il2+/+ T cells (Fig. 1b; summarized in Fig. 1c). Thus, even when Il2−/− T cells underwent the same number of divisions as Il2+/+ T cells, they had diminished production of IFN-γ, suggesting both proliferation-dependent and proliferation-independent effects of IL-2 in TH1 differentiation.

To clarify the role of IL-2 in TH1 differentiation, we examined Il2−/− TH1 differentiated cells for TH1-associated genes. These cells expressed less Ifng as well as less Il12rb2 and Tbx21 (encoding T-bet) mRNA than did WT TH1 cells (Fig. 2a); Ccnd3 (encoding cyclin D3) is shown as a control gene whose expression was not altered (Fig. 2a). Because IFN-γ was reported to drive expression of both Il12rb2 and Tbx21 genes and initiate TH1 differentiation3, 20, we next investigated whether the defective TH1 differentiation of Il2−/− T cells was due to defective IL-2-dependent IFN-γ production. Whereas IL-2 substantially reversed the diminished IFN-γ production observed in the Il2−/− cells (Fig. 2b), the addition of IFN-γ had a smaller effect, as shown by intracellular staining and secreted cytokine (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 2). Interestingly, in this setting, IL-2 substantially restored Il12rb2 mRNA expression, whereas IFN-γ only had a modest effect (Fig. 2c, upper panel). In contrast, IFN-γ appeared slightly better than IL-2 in increasing Tbx21 mRNA expression (Fig. 2c, middle panel). We also examined the effect on mRNA encoding Il21rb1, the other component of the IL-12 receptor. Although Il12rb1 expression was not decreased in Il2−/− T cells, the addition of IL-2 increased its expression (Fig. 2c, lower panel), suggesting that while Il12rb1 expression was not limiting, its induction by IL-2 could potentially further increase IL-12 responsiveness. Consistent with prior reports of a role for IFN-γ in the induction of both the Il12rb2 and Tbx21 genes3, 20, IL-2-induced Il12rb2 and Tbx21 mRNA levels were lower in Ifng−/− CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2d), but the fold induction was not decreased (Fig. 2d), indicating IFN-γ-independent induction by IL-2; thus, the effect of IL-2 in TH1 differentiation is at least partially independent of IFN-γ. This conclusion was further supported by the ability of IL-2 to induce Il12rb2 and Tbx21 mRNA expression in Stat1−/− T cells (Fig. 2e); the basal levels were lower than in the Stat1+/+ T cells, but IL-2 still induced expression. IL-2 also induced Il12rb2 mRNA in Tbx21−/− T cells (Fig. 2f), indicating that it can act independently of T-bet. For unclear reasons, there was increased basal Il12rb2 mRNA expression in the Tbx21−/− T cells (Fig. 2f). IL-2 and IL-12 were previously shown to cooperatively induce Il12rb221, our data now indicate a direct IL-12-independent effect of IL-2. Consistent with effects of both IL-2 and IFN-γ on TH1 differentiation, antibodies to IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ or to IFN-γ decreased Il12rb2 and Tbx21 mRNA expression (Fig. 2g); the antibodies cooperatively inhibited Tbx21 expression, whereas blocking IL-2 or IFN-γ alone decreased Il12rb2 mRNA (Fig. 2g).
IL-2 also induced human IL12RB2 and TBX21 gene (Fig. 3a) and protein (Fig. 3b,c) expression, whereas IFN-γ had little if any effect at 4 h (Fig. 3a-c). We confirmed there was no reproducible significant effect of IFN-γ even at 8 or 24 h time points (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus in both mice and humans, IL-2 promotes expression of IL-12Rβ2 and T-bet. To examine the role of IL-2 in human TH1 differentiation, we used blocking antibodies to IL-2Rα (anti-Tac22) and IL-2Rβ (Mikβ123). When human peripheral blood naïve (CD45RAhighCD25−HLA−DR−) CD4+ T cells were cultured under TH1-polarizing conditions, the anti-IL-2R antibodies decreased IL12RB2, TBX21, and IFNG mRNA induction (Fig. 3d) as well as the percentag
