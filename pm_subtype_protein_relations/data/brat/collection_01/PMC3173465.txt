Critical Role of TCF-1 in Repression of the IL-17 Gene

Overwhelming activation of IL-17, a gene involved in inflammation, leads to exaggerated Th17 responses associated with numerous autoimmune conditions, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here we show that TCF-1 is a critical factor to repress IL-17 gene locus by chromatin modifications during T cell development. Deletion of TCF-1 resulted in increased IL-17 gene expression both in thymus and peripheral T cells, which led to enhanced Th17 differentiation. As a result, TCF-1-/- mice were susceptible to Th17-dependent EAE induction. Rag1-/- mice reconstituted with TCF-1-/- T cells were also susceptible to EAE, indicating TCF-1 is intrinsically required to repress IL-17. However, expression of wild-type TCF-1 or dominant negative TCF-1 did not interfere with Th17 differentiation in mature T cells. Furthermore, expression of TCF-1 in TCF-1-/- T cells could not restore Th17 differentiation to wild-type levels, indicating that TCF-1 cannot affect IL-17 production at the mature T cell stage. This is also supported by the normal up-regulation or activation in mature TCF-1-/- T cells of factors known to regulate Th17 differentiation, including RORγt and Stat3. We observed hyperacetylation together with trimethylation of Lys-4 at the IL-17 locus in TCF-1-/- thymocytes, two epigenetic modifications indicating an open active state of the gene. Such epigenetic modifications were preserved even when TCF-1-/- T cells migrated out of thymus. Therefore, TCF-1 mediates an active process to repress IL-17 gene expression via epigenetic modifications during T cell development. This TCF-1-mediated repression of IL-17 is critical for peripheral T cells to generate balanced immune responses.



In response to antigen stimulation, naïve T cells have the potential to differentiate into multiple lineages of T helpers such as Th1, Th2, Th17 and regulatory T cells (Treg). Because the different T helpers perform distinct, sometimes even opposite, functions [1], balanced differentiation to different T helpers is critical for maintaining properly immune responses. Inappropriately enhanced or reduced potential for forming specific types of T helpers leads to either autoimmunity or immunodeficiency. Many studies have focused on how the cytokine environment regulates T cell differentiation into different types of T helpers; however, little is known about whether and how the developmental process programs T cells to generate balanced immune responses once they migrate out to periphery. Positive and negative selection during development of T cells in the thymus ensures that mature T cells are responsive only to foreign but not self-antigens [2]. Another function of T cell development in the thymus is to program T cells such that they have unbiased potential to form different lineages of T helpers, as biased potential to form a specific type of T helper leads to unbalanced immune responses.
Identification of the Th17 lineage has changed the traditional Th1/Th2 paradigm by adding a new lineage of T helpers [3]. In 2003, Cua et al. made the seminal observation that IL-23, but not the Th1 cytokine IL-12, was critical for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which had long been believed to be a Th1-dependent autoimmune disease [4]. IL-23 was required for the expansion of IL-17-producing pathogenic T cells, which induced EAE when adoptively transferred to naïve mice [5]. Th17 cells produce IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22 cytokines [6], and IL-17 induces massive tissue inflammation due to broad distribution of its receptors on both immune and nonimmune cells [6]. In addition to EAE, Th17 has also been identified as the pathogenic T cell in an animal model of collagen-induced arthritis [7] and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [8]. Circumstantial evidence has also accumulated suggesting the pathologenic role of Th17 cells in multiple human autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis [9], rheumatoid arthritis [10], asthma [11], IBD [12] and psoriasis [13]. A greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for regulating the differentiation of Th17 will therefore facilitate the development of treatments that target Th17-mediated autoimmunity [14]. Stimulation of naïve T cells in the presence of TGFβ and IL-6 is sufficient to form IL-17-producing T cells [15], and IL-6 activates Stat3, which is essential for formation of Th17 cells [16]. In addition, IL-6 and TGFβ together are required to induce RORγt, a master regulator of Th17. T cells deficient in RORγt fail to become IL-17 producing cells, even in the presence of TGFβ and IL-6 [17]. So far, almost all the factors known to interfere with Th17 differentiation do so by direct or indirect regulation of RORγt expression [18]. Peripheral T cells in RORγt-/- mice can form Th17 cells once RORγt is provided [17], suggesting that RORγt is not required for the thymic development of T cells with the potential to form Th17 cells. However, it is still unclear whether the potential of Th17 formation is regulated during T cell development in thymus.
T cell factor 1 (TCF-1) is a transcription factor that is enriched in hematopoietic cells and plays an important role in T cell development in the thymus [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24] as well as T cell differentiation in the periphery [25]. TCF-1 plays an important role in the CD4-CD8- double negative to CD4+CD8+ double positive transition stage [19] and in regulating double positive thymocyte survival [21]. In addition to its function in T cell development, TCF-1 also regulates T cell differentiation. Although T cell activation seems normal in the absence of TCF-1 [19], TCF-1-/- T cells exhibit defects in differentiation to Th2 [25]. TCF-1 promotes Th2 through direct transcriptional activation of GATA-3, a master gene for Th2 differentiation, but likely does not act by affecting Th2 differentiation potential during thymic development, as such an effect can be observed by forced expression of dominant negative TCF-1 in wild-type (WT) mature T cells [25]. Further support for this idea comes from the observation that β-catenin, the TCF-1 co-activator, enhanced TCF-1-mediated stimulation of Th2 differentiation when expressed in WT mature T cells. Therefore, the question still remains whether TCF-1-mediated function in thymus eventually affects T cell function once the cells migrate into the periphery.
In this study, we demonstrate that TCF-1 is required to epigenetically maintain the IL-17 gene locus in a repressive state. Deletion of TCF-1 opens the IL-17 locus during T cell development, resulting in a high potential for differentiation of T cells into Th17 cells. Enhanced Th17 formation by deletion of TCF-1 was also demonstrated by increased susceptibility of TCF-1-/- mice to EAE induction. Furthermore, susceptibility to EAE was also observed when TCF-1-/- T cells were adoptively transferred into Rag1-/- mice, indicating that TCF-1 is intrinsically required to repress IL-17 production. However, forced expression of WT TCF-1 or dominant negative TCF in mature T cells could not interfere with IL-17 expression, suggesting that TCF-1 modulates the IL-17 locus only during the development stage. Once T cells are mature, TCF-1 can no longer affect IL-17 expression. This idea is further enhanced by our finding that forced expression of TCF-1 in TCF-1-/- mature T cells did not change the phenotype of enhanced IL-17 production. Therefore, our results demonstrate that TCF-1 regulates the developmental program to repress the IL-17 locus, resulting in modulation of the potential for Th17 formation of mature T cells.

Naïve (CD4+CD25−CD44lowCD62Lhi) T cells were isolated from lymph nodes and spleens of mice by cell sorting using a FACSAiraII cell sorter (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA). In vitro differentiation of naïve T cells into ThN or Th17 cells was done as described [27]. In brief, 2×105 cells were stimulated with 0.25 µg/mL anti-CD3 (145-2C11, eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and 1 µg/mL anti-CD28 (37.51, eBioscience) in goat-anti-hamster IgG (0.2 mg/mL, MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) pre-coated 24-well plates. For ThN cells, no further supplements were added; for Th17 cells, 10 µg/mL anti-IFN-γ (XMG1.2, BioXcell, West Lebanon, NH), 10 µg/mL anti-IL-4 (11B11, BioXcell), 20 ng/mL mouse IL-6 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and 0.5 ng/mL human TGF-β1 (Peprotech) were added.
