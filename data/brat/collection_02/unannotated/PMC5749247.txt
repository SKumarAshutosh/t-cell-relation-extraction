Immunology of Gut Bone Signaling.

In recent years a link between the gastro-intestinal tract and bone health has started to gain significant attention. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been linked to the pathology of a number of diseases which are associated with bone loss. In addition modulation of the intestinal microbiota with probiotic bacteria has revealed to have both beneficial local and systemic effects. In the present chapter we discuss the intestinal and bone immune systems, explore how intestinal disease affects the immune system and examine how these pathologic changes could adversely impact bone health.
