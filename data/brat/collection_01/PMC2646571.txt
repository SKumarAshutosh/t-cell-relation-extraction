Down-regulation of Gfi-1 expression by TGF-β is important for differentiation of Th17 and CD103+ inducible regulatory T cells

Growth factor independent 1 (Gfi-1), a transcriptional repressor, is transiently induced during T cell activation. Interleukin (IL) 4 further induces Gfi-1, resulting in optimal Th2 cell expansion. We report a second important function of Gfi-1 in CD4 T cells: prevention of alternative differentiation by Th2 cells, and inhibition of differentiation of naive CD4 T cells to either Th17 or inducible regulatory T (iTreg) cells. In Gfi1−/− Th2 cells, the Rorc, Il23r, and Cd103 loci showed histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation modifications that were lacking in wild-type Th2 cells, implying that Gfi-1 is critical for epigenetic regulation of Th17 and iTreg cell–related genes in Th2 cells. Enforced Gfi-1 expression inhibited IL-17 production and iTreg cell differentiation. Furthermore, a key inducer of both Th17 and iTreg cell differentiation, transforming growth factor β, repressed Gfi-1 expression, implying a reciprocal negative regulation of CD4 T cell fate determination. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed direct binding of the Gfi-1–lysine-specific demethylase 1 repressive complex to the intergenic region of Il17a/Il17f loci and to intron 1 of Cd103. T cell–specific Gfi1 conditional knockout mice displayed a striking delay in the onset of experimental allergic encephalitis correlated with a dramatic increase of Foxp3+CD103+ CD4 T cells. Thus, Gfi-1 plays a critical role both in enhancing Th2 cell expansion and in repressing induction of Th17 and CD103+ iTreg cells.


Upon T cell activation, naive CD4+ T cells can differentiate into distinct cell lineages, including the classical Th1 and Th2 cells (1, 2), as well as the recently defined Th cells producing IL-17 (Th17 cells) (3) and inducible Treg (iTreg) cells (4). These cells play important roles in adaptive immunity (5). Th1 cells mainly produce IFN-γ and are involved in immunity against intracellular pathogens. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, are involved in immunity against helminths and other extracellular parasites, and enhance antibody responses. Th17 cells produce IL-17a, IL-17f, IL-21, and IL-22, and are critical for immunity against extracellular bacteria and fungi. Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells are also involved in the induction or maintenance of autoimmune and immunopathologic diseases. Thus, Th1 and Th17 cells are linked to many organ-specific autoimmune diseases, and Th2 cells play critical roles in asthma and other allergic diseases. iTreg cells, functionally similar to naturally occurring Treg cells (6), can regulate immune responses. Among naturally occurring Treg cells, a subset expressing CD103 has been reported to contain the highest suppressive activity and to be present in the mucosal tissues, such as in the gut, as well as at sites of inflammation (7, 8). Interestingly, a large number of CD4 cells differentiated in the presence of TGF-β in vitro express CD103 (9), and TGF-β has been shown to induce Treg cell differentiation (4).
The cytokine milieu during CD4 T cell activation is one of the most important factors in determining T cell fate. IL-12 and IFN-γ induce Th1 cell differentiation (10–12); IL-4 and IL-2 induce Th2 cell differentiation (13–16), TGF-β and IL-6/IL-21 induce Th17 cell differentiation (17–19), and TGF-β and IL-2 induce iTreg cell generation (4, 20). Although several transcription factors are involved in the differentiation and maintenance of each Th cell type, Th cell differentiation is mainly controlled by specific master transcription factors and Stat family members: T-bet and Stat4 for Th1 cells (21–23), GATA-3 and Stat5 for Th2 cells (14, 24–27), RORγt and Stat3 for Th17 cells (28, 29), and Foxp3 and Stat5 for Treg cells (4, 20, 30, 31).
Growth factor independent 1 (Gfi-1), a transcriptional repressor, was initially reported as a protooncogene that allows an IL-2–dependent cell line to be IL-2 independent (32). Gfi-1 was also found as a common insertion site in Moloney murine leukemia virus–induced T lymphomas (33, 34). During Th2 cell differentiation, the expression levels of GATA-3 are enhanced as a result of TCR-mediated signaling and/or activation of the IL-4–Stat6 pathway (35, 36). In collaboration with Stat5, activated by IL-2, GATA-3 induces remodeling of the Il4 locus and the capacity to produce IL-4 when cells are stimulated through TCRs. Gfi-1 is transiently induced by TCR stimulation (37, 38). Its expression is further enhanced and prolonged by IL-4, resulting in optimal Th2 cell proliferation (37). Gfi-1 selects GATA-3hi cells to grow in IL-2, suggesting that there is a selective component involving Gfi-1 in Th2 cell differentiation (37).
Three groups, including ours, have generated germline Gfi1 KO mice (39–41). Many abnormalities have been observed, including neutropenia (39, 40), a T cell development defect (41, 42), a hematopoietic stem cell defect (43, 44), and defects in dendritic cell development and function (45). The profound defect in T cell development in Gfi1−/− mice is associated with a large proportion of their peripheral CD4 T cells displaying memory-like phenotypes (40), presumably as a result of lymphopenia-driven cell proliferation and differentiation.
To analyze the role played by Gfi-1 in the differentiation and/or growth of normal CD4 T cells, we generated Gfi1 conditional KO (Gfi1 cKO) mice (41) in which Gfi-1 is deleted only in T cells. Th2 cells differentiated from Gfi1 cKO mice have a severe defect in cell expansion. In vivo, the Th2 response is dramatically impaired in these KO mice. On the other hand, IFN-γ production is enhanced in the absence of Gfi-1, raising the possibility that Gfi-1 may negatively regulate the differentiation of other Th cell lineages. We report that Gfi-1 suppresses both Th17 and CD103+ iTreg cell differentiation, whereas TGF-β, critical for Th17 and iTreg cell induction, down-regulates Gfi-1 expression. In the absence of Gfi-1, Foxp3+CD103+ Treg cells are preferentially expanded in vivo upon immunization.

Th2 cells lacking Gfi1 display an active genomic configuration at the Cd103, Rorc, and Il23r loci
Th2 cells differentiated from Gfi1 cKO (Gfi1fl/fl-CD4Cre) mice have a severe defect in cell expansion and also produce some IFN-γ, suggesting that Gfi-1 is important for sustaining the Th2 cell phenotype. A recent report suggests that Gfi-1, as a transcriptional repressor, is associated with the histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which results in demethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) at target promoters (46). LSD1 demethylates mono- and dimethylation but not trimethylation of H3K4. However, because of the balance of different methylation states, active gene promoter regions usually contain higher levels of H3K4 trimethylation than of mono- and dimethylation (47). To search for Gfi-1 target genes in T cells, the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–Seq technology was applied. We used H3K4 trimethylation, the end product of H3K4 methylation, as an indicator, reasoning that such modification would not accumulate in Gfi1−/− cells at Gfi-1 target sites because of a lack of the mono- or dimethylated forms of H3K4. As expected, both wild-type and Gfi1 cKO Th2 cells displayed a similar pattern of H3K4 trimethylation at the Gata3 locus (Fig. 1 A).1 Because H3K4 methylation is associated with active chromatin, this indicates that Gfi-1, although important for Th2 expansion, is not essential for the Th2 polarization process. Interestingly, at the Cd103 locus, whose expression is associated with a subset of Treg cells, Gfi1 cKO Th2 cells showed high levels of H3K4 modification that was absent in wild-type Th2 or Th17 cells (Fig. 1 B). At the Rorc locus, which encodes RORγt, critical for Th17 cell differentiation, Gfi1 cKO Th2 cells displayed levels of H3K4 modification similar to Th17 cells (Fig. 1 C). H3K4 modification was also detected at the Il23r locus in Gfi1 cKO Th2 cells (Fig. 1 D). Such a modification was absent in wild-type Th2 cells. Gfi1 cKO Th2 cells did not appear to be contaminated with Th17 cells, because H3K4 trimethylation at the Il21 and Il17f loci was not observed the Gfi1 cKO Th2 cells, although it was prominent in Th17 cells (Fig. 1, E and F). These results indicate that Gfi-1 plays an important role in chromatin remodeling of Th17 and iTreg cell–related genes, including Rorc, Il23r, and Cd103, in Th2 cells. Although Gfi1 cKO Th2 cells displayed an active Rorc locus, expression of RORγt in Gfi1 cKO Th2 cells is much lower than that in Th17 cells (unpublished data), indicating that additional factors, possibly induced by TGF-β and IL-6, are required for Rorc expression as well as for the induction of IL-17.

Abnormal histone H3K4 trimethylation at the Cd103, Rorc, and Il23r loci in Gfi1 cKO Th2 cells. CD4+ T cells from naive wild-type or Gfi1 cKO mice were activated under Th2 or Th17 conditions for 4 d. Cells were harvested and fixed. ChIP-Seq analysis was performed using a specific antibody against H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). The sequence tags mapped to the locus of (A) Gata3, (B) Cd103, (C) Rorc, (D) Il23r, (E) Il21, and (F) Il17f are shown. The total tag numbers mapped to the genome are 2, 6, and 7.1 million for WT-Th17, Gfi1 cKO–Th2, and WT-Th2, respectively. The scale for the WT-Th17 sample was adjusted separately because of approximately threefold fewer total tag numbers.

To test the significance of the chromatin modification change at the Rorc locus, wild-type or Gfi1 cKO CD4 T cells were primed under Th2 conditions for one round, and cells were then either restimulated under Th2 conditions or switched to Th17 priming conditions. Gfi1 cKO Th2 cells expanded less well than wild-type Th2 cells, as previously reported (41); the expansion defect of Gfi1 cKO Th2 cells was smaller when they were cultured under Th17 conditions (Fig. 2 A). In the wild-type group, 24.5% of the cells from the culture resti
