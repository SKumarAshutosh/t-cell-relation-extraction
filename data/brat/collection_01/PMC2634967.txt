High CD8+ T Cell Activation Marks a Less Differentiated HIV-1 Specific CD8+ T Cell Response that Is Not Altered by Suppression of Viral Replication


Background
The relationship of elevated T cell activation to altered T cell differentiation profiles, each defining features of HIV-1 infection, has not been extensively explored. We hypothesized that anti-retroviral suppression of T cell activation levels would lead to alterations in the T cell differentiation of total and HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cell responses among recently HIV-1 infected adults.


Methodology/Principal Findings
We performed a longitudinal study simultaneously measuring T cell activation and maturation markers on both total and antigen-specific T cells in recently infected adults: prior to treatment; after the initiation of HAART; and after treatment was halted. Prior to treatment, HIV-1 Gag–specific CD8+ T cells were predominantly of a highly activated, intermediate memory (CD27+CD28−) phenotype, while CMV pp65-specific CD8+ T cells showed a late memory (CD27−CD28−), low activation phenotype. Participants with the highest fraction of late memory (CD27−CD28−) HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells had higher CD4+ T cell counts (rho = +0.74, p = 0.004). In turn, those with the highest fraction of intermediate memory (CD27+ CD28−) HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cells had high total CD8+ T cell activation (rho = +0.68, p = 0.01), indicating poorer long-term clinical outcomes. The HIV-1 specific T cell differentiation profile was not readily altered by suppression of T cell activation following HAART treatment.


Conclusions/Significance
A more differentiated, less activated HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cell response may be clinically protective. Anti-retroviral treatment initiated two to four months after infection lowered T cell activation but had no effect on the differentiation profile of the HIV-1-specific response. Intervention during the first month of acute infection may be required to shift the differentiation phenotype of HIV-1 specific responses to a more clinically favorable profile.




Elevated CD8+ T cell activation is established early in HIV-1 infection [1], is a hallmark of HIV-1 disease [2] and predicts subsequent poor clinical outcome in a manner independent of viral load [1]. Furthermore, elevated CD8+ T cell activation, and not viral load, distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic lentiviral infections [3]–[6]. These observations have lead to a general consensus that CD8+ T cell activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of immunodeficiency. Yet the mechanism whereby elevated CD8+ T cell activation leads to immunodeficiency during untreated HIV-1 disease remains unclear. The T cell response to HIV-1 is marked by a second distinguishing feature. Several groups have observed that HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cells fail to differentiate to a fully mature effector cell [7], [8]. We hypothesized that a block in T cell maturation may be related to elevated activation on HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cells, and be relieved by suppression of T cell activation levels by anti-retroviral treatment (ART).
On encountering antigen CD8+ T cells differentiate from the least differentiated (naïve or early memory) stage to the most mature (memory/effector) stage. In this process, cell surface receptors are progressively down-regulated (CD45RA CCR7, CD28, CD27, CD127) as CD8+ T cells differentiate and up-regulated or re-expressed (CD57, CD45RA). While there is broad general agreement on how to define a naïve T cell, there is not yet a unified model that describes the process of human T cell differentiation (reviewed by Appay et al 2008 [9]) but memory cells can be divided into Early (EM), Intermediate (IM) and Late (LM) stages using CD27 and CD28. T cell differentiation profiles have been found to differ across antigen specificities, and may relate to the effectiveness of long-term control [10], [11]. The CMV-specific CD8+ T cell response displays a predominantly late memory phenotype. As CMV infection is typically well controlled in adults, this suggests a more differentiated phenotype may be beneficial [12]. The reverse is true for HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells, which are enriched for a more intermediate memory phenotype. Likewise, in chronic, virulent HCV infection there is an expansion of the intermediate memory and a lack of late memory, HCV specific CD8+ cells [13]. Among EBV/HIV-1 co-infected persons, the absence of differentiated EBV specific CD8+ T cells has been associated with EBV-associated non-Hodgkins lymphoma [8].
As yet there has been limited work measuring the simultaneous expression of activation and differentiation markers on HIV-specific T cells [14]–[16]. Here, we used polychromatic flow cytometry to examine the co-expression of CD38, CD27 and CD28 on total T cells and antigen-specific (HIV, CMV) T cells in a cohort of adults in early HIV-1 infection (within 6 months of acquisition). This approach allowed us to examine the relationship between T cell activation and differentiation, relate these profiles to HIV clinical markers among recently HIV-1 infected adults, and determine if effective anti-retroviral therapy can durably alter these profiles. We observed that HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8+ T cells were predominantly of an IM phenotype and were significantly more activated than LM Gag-specific CD8+ T cells. Individuals with the highest CD8+ T cell activation levels also had the greatest proportion of IM Gag-specific CD8+ T cells while those with the highest proportion of more differentiated LM Gag-specific CD8+ T cells had the highest CD4+ T cell counts. Together these data suggest that the presence of mature Gag-specific CD8+ T cells with low levels of activation may be protective during early infection. Our analysis may serve as a resource to researchers who seek to understand the relationship of key T cell markers to one another, as part of an effort to describe an effective T cell response to HIV-1.

Demographic, laboratory and clinical markers at all three study time-points (pre-therapy baseline visit 1, on anti-retroviral therapy visit 2, and post-anti-retroviral therapy visit 3) are shown in Table 1.

Demographic, Clinical and Laboratory Measures By Study Time-point

Treatment (anti-retroviral therapy) is defined as at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and either 1 protease inhibitor (PI), 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nnRTI), or a PI and a nnRTI. All patients were treatment naïve at study entry.

Magnitude of T cell responses to HIV-1 Gag and CMV pp65 over time
The magnitude of IFN-γ and IFN-γ/IL-2 CD8+ T cell responses to HIV-1 Gag were lower than the response to CMV pp65 at visit 1 (prior to therapy), and subsequent study time points during and after anti-retroviral therapy (Fig. 2). The magnitude of Gag IFN-γ CD8+ T cell responses declined during virologically suppressive anti-retroviral therapy, while the magnitude of responses for CMV pp65 did not change.

Magnitude of CD4+ and CD8+ T Cell Responses to HIV-1 Gag and CMV pp65. at each of the three study visits.
Proportion of IFN-γ+ and IFN-γ+IL-2+ CD8+ (columns 1 and 2) and CD4+ (columns 3 and 4) T cells, responding to stimulation with Gag and pp65 peptide pools. Results for visit 1, prior to antiretroviral therapy visit 2, during a virologically suppressive anti-retroviral regimen, and visit 3, after patients had halted an anti-retroviral regimen and viremia had rebounded are shown in upper, middle and lower rows respectively. Black bars indicate differences between HIV-1 Gag and CMV pp65 responses by response category (Wilcoxon 2 Sample Test). Red dot (1st column, 2nd row) notes a significant change from baseline (visit 1) values (Sign Rank Test). Only the CD8+ T cell IFN-γ response to Gag was observed to significantly change (in this case decline) from visit 1 to either visit 2 or visit 3.

At visit 1, prior to anti-retroviral therapy, the naïve and early memory CD8+ T cell subset (EM:CD27+CD28+) was most frequent (median 43.3% Interquartile range (IQR) 41.4, 49.7) followed by the intermediate memory (IM:CD27+CD28−, median 31.20% (IQR 23.8, 44.6)) and late memory (LM:CD27−CD28−) median 16.3% (IQR 10.8, 33.4)) subsets (Fig. 3). Following initiation of anti-retroviral therapy the total CD8+ T cell population shifted out of the intermediate memory CD27+CD28− phenotype, with a greater fraction now falling in the early memory CD27+CD28+ CD8+ T cell population. Once therapy was halted there was a partial but incomplete shift towards an expansion of the intermediate memory pool, but this fraction remained below pre-treatment levels. The total CD4+ T cell differentiation profile did not shift in response to treatment.
