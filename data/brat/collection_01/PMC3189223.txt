Shared and Distinct Functions of the Transcription Factors IRF4 and IRF8 in Myeloid Cell Development

Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 8 and IRF4 are structurally-related, hematopoietic cell-specific transcription factors that cooperatively regulate the differentiation of dendritic cells and B cells. Whilst in myeloid cells IRF8 is known to modulate growth and differentiation, the role of IRF4 is poorly understood. In this study, we show that IRF4 has activities similar to IRF8 in regulating myeloid cell development. The ectopic expression of IRF4 in myeloid progenitor cells in vitro inhibits cell growth, promotes macrophages, but hinders granulocytic cell differentiation. We also show that IRF4 binds to and activates transcription through the IRF-Ets composite sequence (IECS). Furthermore, we demonstrate that Irf8
-/-
Irf4
-/- mice exhibit a more severe chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like disease than Irf8
-/- mice, involving a disproportionate expansion of granulocytes at the expense of monocytes/macrophages. Irf4
-/- mice, however, display no obvious abnormality in myeloid cell development, presumably because IRF4 is expressed at a much lower level than IRF8 in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Our results also suggest that IRF8 and IRF4 have not only common but also specific activities in myeloid cells. Since the expression of both the IRF8 and IRF4 genes is downregulated in CML patients, these results may add to our understanding of CML pathogenesis.



Cell differentiation requires appropriate changes in gene expression patterns, which are tightly regulated by cell type-specific transcription factors. In case of hematopoiesis, dysregulation of these processes can result in hematopoietic disorders such as leukemias [1]. Myeloid progenitor cells, defined as granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) [2], give rise to granulocytes (such as neutrophils) or monocytes/macrophages. A number of transcription factors including PU.1, C/EBPs and Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8) have been shown to regulate this process. While PU.1 is essential for macrophage differentiation in particular, C/EBPα and C/EBPε are the critical drivers of granulocyte differentiation [3]. We have shown previously that IRF8, a hematopoietic cell-specific factor belonging to the IRF family, directs macrophage differentiation whilst it inhibits myeloid cell growth and neutrophil differentiation [4], [5]. We have also previously identified an IRF8's target DNA element termed the IRF-Ets Composite Element (IECS; represented by GAAANN[N]GGAA) and multiple direct target genes including those encoding Blimp-1, Cathepsin C and Cystatin C [6], [7]. Importantly, mice lacking the Irf8 gene (Irf8
-/- mice) develop a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-like syndrome, in which there is a disproportionate expansion of neutrophils at the expense of monocytes/macrophages [8], [9], [10]. Furthermore, cells from human CML patients lack the expression of IRF8
[11], suggesting that its loss is a key aspect of human CML pathogenesis. Conservation of IRF8's function between mice and humans has been proven by a recent study demonstrating that a loss-of-function mutation in the human IRF8 gene also results in a very high neutrophil count and an absence of circulating monocytes and dendritic cells [12].
IRF4 is another hematopoietic cell-specific IRF and has the highest amino acid sequence similarity with IRF8. Consistent with this structural similarity, both IRFs have an ability to interact with the Ets transcription factor PU.1, required also for B cell differentiation, and to activate transcription via the Ets-IRF Composite Element (EICE; GGAANNGAAA) [13]. The EICE is another DNA sequence targeted by IRF and PU.1, and is active at the promoters of B cell-specific genes such as immunoglobulin light chain genes. In fact, IRF4 and IRF8 are expressed in B lineage cells and cooperatively stimulate the development of B cells [14]. In dendritic cells (DCs) consisting of multiple subsets, these two IRFs are expressed in a subset-selective manner and govern the generation of corresponding subsets [15], [16] via their common and specific activities [16]. It has been reported also that IRF4, like IRF8, is expressed in macrophages [17]. However, the role of IRF4 in myeloid cell development remains poorly understood. In our current study, we have examined whether IRF4 has any roles in regulating myeloid cell growth and differentiation through gene introduction experiments and through the analysis of mice lacking Irf4 and/or Irf8.

All animal experimentations were conducted in accordance with NIH and Public Health Service (PHS) policy or the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments (Science Council of Japan), and all protocols were approved by Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #08-010) or institutional review boards in Yokohama City University (Protocol #09-127, 10-122).

Tot2 and 32Dcl.3 cells were cultured as described previously in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (Peprotech) at 2.5 ng/ml and 10% WEHI3B-conditioned medium as a source of interleukin-3 (IL-3), respectively [4]. When inducing neutrophil differentiation in 32Dcl.3 cells, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, Peprotech) was used at 10 ng/ml. To generate pMSCV-puro (Clontech) and pMSCV-CD8t [7] vectors carrying IRF8FLAG or IRF4FLAG, the FLAG peptide sequence was added to the 3′ side of Irf4 or Irf8 cDNA before the stop codon by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase. The resulting fragments were then inserted into the vectors. pSIRV-IECS-Ld40-GFP has been described previously [7]. pSIRV-mIECS-Ld40-GFP was constructed by inserting three copies of a mutant IECS fragment (GAAACAGGGAA to GCTGCAGGGAA) into pSIRV-GFP. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Retroviral preparation and transduction were performed as described previously [7]. Transduced cells were purified by puromycin treatment (2 µg/mL) or immunomagnetic cell sorting. Irf8
-/- mice in a C57BL/6 background were described previously [16] and used at 7 to 9 weeks of age.

Total RNA was prepared using RNAiso Plus (Takara Bio), treated with DNase I (Invitrogen), and reverse transcribed using Primescript (Takara Bio) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in triplicate using the THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo) and the ABI 7500 or StepOnePlus real-time PCR systems (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturers' protocols. The following primers were used: Msr1 (sense, 5′-ATC ACC AAC GAC CTC AGA CT-3′; antisense, 5′-CCG ATC ACC TTT AAC ACC T-3′), Irf5 (sense, 5′-ATG TCC TGG ACC GTG GGC TC-3′; antisense, 5′-GAA CAC CTT ACA CTG GCA CAG ACG-3′), Mrc1 (sense, 5′-AGC CCA CAC CTG CTC CAC AAG A-3′; antisense, 5′-GCT CGC GCG TTG TCC ATG GTT-3′), Il12b (sense, 5′-GAC ACG CCT GAA GAA GAT GAC-3′; antisense, 5′-TAG TCC CTT TGG TCC AGT GTG-3′), Il6 (sense, 5′-AGT TGC CTT CTT GGG ACT GA-3′; antisense, 5′-TCC ACG ATT TCC CAG AGA AC-3′), Csf3r (sense, 5′-CCC ACC ATC ATG ACA GAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CAG TGG GTC GGT TTC TTG T-3′), Irf4 (sense, 5′-TCG GCC CAA CAA GCT AGA AA-3′; antisense, 5′-GGC CAT GGT GAG CAA ACA CT-3′), Irf8 (sense, 5′-ATA TGC CGC CTA TGA CAC ACA CC-3′; antisense, 5′-TTG CCC CCG TAG TAG AAG CTG A-3′). The primers used to analyze the other genes tested in this study were as previously described [6], [7], [16]. Each of the primer sets produced a unique product. Data were analyzed using either the ΔΔCT method or the standard curve method, and normalized against the Gapdh expression levels.

For cell-surface marker analysis, cells were stained as described previously [16] with the appropriate antibodies and analyzed by FACSCalibur or FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). A phagocytosis assay was performed using Vybrant Phagocytosis Assay Kit (Invitrogen). In this experiment, the cells were incubated with fluorescein-labeled E. coli K-12 bioparticles at 37°C for 2 h, then washed twice before analysis by flow cytometry. As a control reaction, cells were incubated at 4°C. The resulting data were analyzed using the FlowJo software (TreeStar). For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in cold 70% ethanol, treated with 100 ng/mL RNaseA, and stained with 50 µg/mL propidium iodide. Stained cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur and cell cycle profiles obtained by using CellQuest and ModFitLD V2.0 software (BD Biosciences). Cell sorting was performed using FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) or MoFlo (Dako Cytomation) into the following lineages: common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), Lin− (lineage marker-negative, CD5− B220− CD11b− Gr1− 7/4−Ter119−), IL-7Rα− c-Kit+ Sca-1− CD34+ FcγRII/III−; GMPs, Lin− IL-7Rα− c-Kit+ Sca-1− CD34+ FcγRII/III+; granulocytes, CD11c− CD11b+ F4/80− Gr1+; T cells, CD3+; B cells, CD19+; plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), CD11c+ PDCA-1+ B220+; and classical DCs (cDCs), CD11c+ PDCA-1− B220−. CMPs and GMPs were obtained from bone marrow. Lin− cells were enriched by the Lineage Cell Depletion Kit and the AutoMACS cell separation system (Miltenyi Biotec). Resident macrophages were obtained from the peritoneal cavity and purified using plastic plate adherence. Other cell types were obtained from the spleen. The purity of the sorted cells was >95%. 7-Amino-Actinomycin D (eBioscience) was used to exclude dead cells. Antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen, eBioscience or BioLegend.

Reporter assays were performed as described previously [7] with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were transduced with SIRV-IECS-Ld40-GFP or SIRV-mIECS-Ld40-GFP reporter constructs, selected with puromycin, and then transduced with MSCV-CD8t vectors harboring IRF4FLAG or IRF8FLAG. Transduced cells were stained with anti-human CD8 conjugated with Cy-Chrome (BD Pharmingen). The promoter activities were analyzed using a FACSCanto II on day 2 after the transduction of MSCVs to acquire GFP signals in CD8+ cells. The data were analyzed
